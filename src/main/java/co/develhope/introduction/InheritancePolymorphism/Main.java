/**
 * Exercise: Polymorphism
 * Define a class Animal that has:
 *
 * an instance variable animalName
 * a constructor that instantiate animalName
 * a method animalSound()
 * achieve polymorphism by using method overloading on animalSound()
 * if there are no parameters, animalSound() will be Roarr!
 * if there is just 1 string param called intensity, animalSound() will be:
 * Roarrrrrrrr! if intensity is high
 * Roar if intensity is low
 * Cannot reproduce it properly in other cases
 * Define a tester class where you create an Animal object and call the 2 versions of the method
